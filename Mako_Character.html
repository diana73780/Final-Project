  <h1>Mako Mankanshoku</h1>
    <h2>Diana N.</h2>
    <p>Grew up… poor but happy. Growing up with her parents and younger brother, Mako has never been particularly wealthy, but she's never lacked in the love department.</p>

`     <p>Living… in the slums of Honno City. A second-year student at Honnoji Academy, Mako is a no-star student, meaning that her family is relegated to housing in Honno's poor district.</p>

  <p>Profession… high school student. Although her numbers of stars at Honnoji determine her family's standard of living, Mako doesn't put too much effort into school, preferring to cheerfully sleep through classes instead of studying.</p>

    <p>Interests… food, money, and her friends. Although growing up poor has given Mako a keen interest in the former two, she always puts her friends above material matters. When sharing her food with transfer student Ryuko, Mako happily invites her to dig in: "Go ahead, Ryuko! Don't be shy!" Of course, the food is full of maggots, but it's the thought that counts.</p>

    </p>Relationship Status… single. While generally oblivious, Mako does know what relationships are, but she seems more interested in helping Ryuko than in romance.</p>

  </p>Challenge… helping her best friend. From inviting Ryuko to living with her family to cheering her on during battles with other classmates, Mako does everything in her power to support Ryuko. And while Ryuko might be busy looking for her father's killer, it's going to take more than a few murderous classmates to stop Mako from hanging out with her bestie.</P>

</p>Personality… cheerful and caring, if ditzy. While she lacks for nothing in friendliness, Mako's not exactly the brightest bulb in the box. In fact, with her grades, it's kind of a wonder she's made it to high school at all. Still, what she lacks in common sense, Mako makes up for in sheer optimism and force of personality. After all, as she tells a critic: “I'm Mako Mankanshoku! I may be an underachiever, but I do have a name!”</p>

  </p>See Her In... the anime. By the creative force behind the critically acclaimed Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill focuses on the adventures of Ryuko Matoi, a tough schoolgirl determined to avenge her father's death. From this simple premise, however, spawns an action-packed show full of deliciously over-the-top fight scenes and characters in the style of Gurren Lagann. Though its risqué content may turn off some viewers, Kill la Kill's playful animation and well-written characters are sure to please many.</p>
