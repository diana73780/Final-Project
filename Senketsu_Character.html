  <h1>Kamui Senketsu</h1>
    <h2>Diana N.</h2>
    <p>After suffering a crushing defeat by the Student Council, Ryuko finds this living Sailor Fuku beneath her house. Named Senketsunote  by Ryuko, he is a garment known as a Kamuinote  that grants its wearer phenomenal abilities in exchange for their blood. He was made by Ryuko's father Isshin, though he doesn't remember much more than that.</p>

    <p>Senketsu appears to be a navy-blue and red sailor suit with the midriff shown and a lower-cut skirt. When Senketsu is on his own, the section between the shirt and skirt resembles a mouth, in that he is attached to his lower jaw at the back. When he is worn, however, the skirt is connected to the upper body by three suspenders. He speaks to RyÅ«ko with a deep male voice and everyone refers to him with male pronouns, even though Kamui are technically agender entities.</p>
