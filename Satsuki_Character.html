  <h1>Satsuki Kiryuin</h1>
    <h2>Diana N.</h2>
    <p>Grew up... heir to the Kiryuin conglomerate. The daughter of CEO Ragyo Kiryuin, Satsuki grew up with all the wealth and power of Japan's most powerful company.</p>

      <p>Living… in Honnoji Academy, an elite school that her family owns, along with most of the surrounding land. Run like a military dictatorship, Honnoji is headed by Satsuki and the other members of the Student Council, who parcel out rewards and harsh punishment depending on student behavior. Among the rewards are economic wealth and Goku uniforms, clothes sown with Life Fibers that grant their wearers superhuman strength. Among the punishments? Death.</p>

        <p>Profession… officially, high school student. But as Honnoji's Student Council president, Satsuki is the most powerful person in Honno City, and she uses that power to implement an ironclad rule on the Academy and the City.</p>

          <p>Interests… power, and maintaining it whenever possible. Strong-willed since childhood, Satsuki views weaker people with contempt, describing "those who lack resolve" as "incapable of even wiping away their own tears."</p>

          <p>Relationship Status… single. Satsuki's role as Student Council president leaves little time for friends, much less relationships.</p>

        <p>Challenge… maintaining her power over Honnoji Academy and the surrounding city. When schoolgirl Ryuko Matoi comes to Honnoji, searching for father's killer and wearing a uniform composed entirely of Life Fibers, Satsuki's reign of power suddenly faces a new challenger. But though she’s intrigued, Satsuki isn't too worried. After all, Satsuki still wields power over Honnoji, and her command over the sewing club means Satsuki has secret weapons of her own...</p>

        <p>Personality… regal and ruthless. Intellectually and physically strong, Satsuki is a formidable foe, seemingly always one step ahead of any dissidents to her reign. However, despite her stoicism, Satsuki's not emotionless: she does genuinely care about her subordinates and may even have hidden motives behind her ruthless regimes. But whatever her true goals, there's no doubting Satsuki's determination. As she puts it: “If it means fulfilling her ambitions, Satsuki Kiryuin will show neither shame nor hesitation, even if she bares her breasts for all the world to see!"</p>
